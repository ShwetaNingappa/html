# 🎨 Bootstrap Color Palette Viewer

This project is a simple, responsive web page that displays a selection of Bootstrap 4 color utility classes using cards and grid layout. It's designed to help developers and designers quickly visualize the default color options available in Bootstrap.

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive grid layout using Bootstrap's grid system
- Visual representation of Bootstrap background color classes:
  - `bg-primary`
  - `bg-secondary`
  - `bg-success`
  - `bg-info`
  - `bg-danger`
  - `bg-warning`
- Uses Bootstrap 4 CDN for styling and layout
- Includes jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap JS for future interactivity

## 📦 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Bootstrap 4.5.2
- jQuery 3.5.1 (slim build)
- Popper.js 1.16.1

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. View the color palette in a responsive card layout.

## 📌 Notes

- The `bg-magenta` class is not a default Bootstrap utility and will not render unless custom CSS is added.
- One of the color boxes (`bg-danger`) has a misplaced `<p>` tag—consider fixing it for proper rendering.
- You can extend this palette by adding custom colors or integrating a color picker.
